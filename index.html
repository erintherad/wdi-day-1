Three things I learned from the article: "How does the internet work? By Jonathan Strickland"

1.  The internet nearly ran out of IP addresses, so IPv6, a 128-bit system was created.
2.  TCP/IP help to establish the rules for how information is passed through the internet.
3.  Packets take on multiple paths to reach their destination.
